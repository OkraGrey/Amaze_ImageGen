# Image Generation Web Application Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing a web application that allows users to upload an image (optionally) and provide a text prompt. The system will then process these inputs through Google's Gemini API to generate a new image, which will be displayed to the user. The application builds upon existing functionality in generation.py, which already implements basic image generation using Gemini.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Alternative**: Next.js (discussed below)
- **Components**:
  - Image upload area with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Text prompt input field
  - "Go" button to initiate processing
  - Result display area
  - Loading indicators
  - Error handling UI elements

### Backend
- **Technology**: Python
- **Components**:
  - API endpoint to receive image and prompt
  - Image processing module
  - LLM integration
  - Response handling
  - File storage management

### Communication
- REST API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend
- WebSockets for real-time progress updates (optional enhancement)

## Detailed Components

### Frontend Implementation

#### HTML Structure
- Clean, responsive layout similar to the provided UI inspiration
- Form with:
  - File input with preview capability and drag-and-drop zone
  - Text input for prompt (to be added to the design)
  - "Go" button to initiate processing (styled consistently with the inspiration UI)
  - Result display area for the generated image

#### CSS Styling
- Modern, minimalist design
- Responsive for all device sizes
- Clear visual feedback for interactions
- Loading states and animations

#### JavaScript Functionality
- Image preview before upload
- Form validation
- AJAX requests to backend
- Response handling and image display
- Error handling and user feedback

### Backend Implementation

#### API Endpoints
- `/upload` - POST endpoint to receive image and prompt
- `/status/<job_id>` - GET endpoint to check processing status (optional)
- `/result/<job_id>` - GET endpoint to retrieve generated image

#### Image Processing
- Validate uploaded image (format, size, content)
- Preprocess image if needed (resize, normalize)
- Store temporarily for processing

#### LLM Integration
- Integrate with Google's Gemini API (as used in existing generation.py)
- Configure API authentication and key management
- Send image and prompt to Gemini model (currently using "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview")
- Process response from LLM (extract generated image from response parts)
- Error handling for LLM service issues
- Implement guardrails for quality checks (as noted in Findings.md)

#### Result Management
- Store generated images
- Clean up temporary files
- Implement caching strategy for frequent requests (optional)

## Data Flow
1. User uploads image (optional) and enters text prompt
2. Frontend validates inputs and sends to backend
3. Backend processes request and sends to LLM
4. LLM generates image based on inputs
5. Backend receives generated image and stores it
6. Backend sends response to frontend
7. Frontend displays the generated image to user

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Frontend
- No image uploaded (handle optional image case)
- Invalid image format/size
- Empty prompt
- Network errors during upload/download
- Timeout handling
- Browser compatibility issues

### Backend
- File size limits and validation
- Malicious file detection
- Rate limiting
- LLM service downtime or errors
- Processing timeouts
- Storage management (cleanup of temporary files)

### General
- User session management
- Concurrent request handling
- Service availability monitoring

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Secure file handling
- API key protection
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Content moderation for inputs and outputs

## Technology Choice Considerations

### Pure HTML/CSS/JS + Python Backend
**Advantages:**
- Simplicity in setup and deployment
- No framework overhead
- Easy to understand for developers
- Lightweight client-side experience

**Disadvantages:**
- More manual work for responsive design
- Limited built-in features
- State management can become complex

### Next.js + Python Backend
**Advantages:**
- Built-in routing and API routes
- Server-side rendering options
- Better performance for complex UIs
- Modern development experience
- Easier state management
- Better code organization

**Disadvantages:**
- Additional learning curve
- More complex setup
- Potential overhead for simple applications

## Recommendation
For this specific application, the pure HTML/CSS/JS approach should be sufficient if:
- The UI is relatively simple
- There's no need for complex routing
- Server-side rendering isn't critical

However, Next.js would be beneficial if:
- You anticipate the application growing in complexity
- You want better performance optimization out of the box
- You need more structured API route handling
- You plan to add more interactive features in the future

Given the requirement to "keep things simple and handy," the pure HTML/CSS/JS approach with a Python backend is recommended as the starting point, with the option to migrate to Next.js if requirements evolve.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure
- Set up project directories
- Create basic HTML/CSS layout based on the provided UI inspiration
- Implement image upload functionality with drag-and-drop
- Add prompt text field to the UI design
- Create Python backend skeleton leveraging existing generation.py code

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implement prompt input and validation
- Create backend API endpoints (Flask/FastAPI recommended)
- Refactor existing Gemini integration from generation.py for web use
- Implement secure API key management
- Implement basic error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Connect frontend and backend
- Implement full data flow
- Test with various inputs
- Handle edge cases

### Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization
- Improve UI/UX
- Optimize performance
- Enhance error handling
- Add additional features (if needed)

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Prepare for production
- Set up hosting and deployment
- Configure monitoring
- Document usage

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Phase 5: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 9-14 days (depending on complexity and familiarity with technologies)

## Future Enhancements
- User accounts and saved images
- Advanced prompt options and templates
- Image editing capabilities
- Batch processing
- Social sharing features
- Image history and comparison
- Improved guardrails and quality checks (as mentioned in Findings.md)
- Support for different Gemini models and parameters
- Customizable cultural prompts (building on existing cultural_prompt in generation.py)
