# PhotoRoom Integration & Download Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented PhotoRoom API for background removal and fixed browser download functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **PhotoRoom API Integration** (`backend/utils/file_utils.py`)
- **Replaced:** `rembg` library with PhotoRoom API
- **API Key:** Uses `PHOTOTOOM_API_KEY` from `.env` file
- **Features:**
  - Professional background removal via PhotoRoom API
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
  - Full logging at every step for debugging

**Key Code Changes:**
```python
# Old: Using rembg library
from rembg import remove
output = remove(img)

# New: Using PhotoRoom API
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection('sdk.photoroom.com')
headers = {
    'x-api-key': api_key,
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
}
conn.request('POST', '/v1/segment', body, headers)
```

### 2. **Browser Download Fix** (`frontend/static/js/app.js`)
- **Problem:** Files weren't actually downloading to Downloads folder
- **Solution:** Fetch image as blob and create blob URL for download
- **Features:**
  - Shows "Processing..." during background removal
  - Downloads with timestamp in filename
  - Proper blob URL cleanup
  - Console logging for debugging

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Old: Just creating a link with relative path
link.href = data.path;  // Won't trigger actual download

// New: Fetch as blob and create blob URL
const blob = await imageResponse.blob();
const blobUrl = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
link.href = blobUrl;  // Triggers actual download
```

## Complete Workflow

1. **User clicks Download button**
   - Button shows "Processing..." state
   - Console logs: `[INFO]--- Starting download process ---`

2. **Backend processes request** (`/api/download` endpoint)
   - Receives image path
   - Calls PhotoRoom API for background removal
   - Saves processed image with `_no_bg_[uuid]` suffix
   - Returns new image path

3. **Frontend completes download**
   - Fetches processed image as blob
   - Creates blob URL for download
   - Triggers browser download to Downloads folder
   - Cleans up blob URL after download

## Logging & Debugging

### Backend Logs (Terminal)
```
[INFO]--- DOWNLOAD REQUEST RECEIVED ---
[INFO]--- Original path from request: /results/generated_xxx.png ---
[INFO]--- Starting PhotoRoom background removal for: results\generated_xxx.png ---
[INFO]--- Calling PhotoRoom API for background removal ---
[INFO]--- PhotoRoom background removal successful ---
[INFO]--- Image saved to: results\generated_xxx_no_bg_yyy.png ---
```

### Frontend Logs (Browser Console)
```
[INFO]--- Starting download process ---
[INFO]--- Calling backend for background removal ---
[INFO]--- Background removal complete, path: /results/xxx_no_bg.png
[INFO]--- Fetching processed image as blob ---
[INFO]--- Image blob received, size: 1413793
[INFO]--- Download triggered successfully ---
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created:
1. **`test_photoroom_integration.py`** - Tests PhotoRoom API integration
2. **`test_bg_removal.py`** - Tests OpenAI background removal (deprecated)

### Running Tests:
```bash
python test_photoroom_integration.py
```

Expected Output:
```
[TEST]--- [OK] PhotoRoom API key found
[TEST]--- [SUCCESS] Background removal successful!
[TEST]--- [PASSED] PhotoRoom Integration Test PASSED
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (`.env`):
```env
PHOTOTOOM_API_KEY="your_photoroom_api_key_here"
```

### Dependencies:
- No new Python dependencies required (uses built-in `http.client`)
- Removed dependency on `rembg` library

## Benefits of PhotoRoom API

1. **Better Quality:** Professional-grade background removal
2. **Consistency:** Reliable results across different image types
3. **Speed:** Fast API response times
4. **Transparency:** Creates proper transparent PNGs
5. **No Local Processing:** Offloads heavy computation to API
