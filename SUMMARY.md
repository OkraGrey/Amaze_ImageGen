# Image Generation Web App - Project Summary

## Project Overview
We've successfully built a web application that allows users to generate images using Google's Gemini API. Users can optionally upload an image as a reference, provide a text prompt, and receive an AI-generated image based on their input.

## Implemented Features
1. **Backend API**
   - Gemini service integration for image generation
   - File upload handling with validation
   - Result retrieval endpoint

2. **Frontend UI**
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Image preview functionality
   - Loading indicators and error handling
   - Download capability for generated images

3. **Project Structure**
   - Modular backend architecture
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Well-organized frontend assets

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Docker configuration
   - Environment variable management
   - Documentation

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Next Steps
1. **Enhanced Features**
   - User accounts and saved images
   - Advanced prompt templates
   - Additional Gemini model options
   - Image gallery of past generations

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production-grade web server
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Scale with container orchestration

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Secure API key management
   - Input validation improvements

## Conclusion
The Image Generation Web App is now ready for testing and deployment. The application provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features as needed.
